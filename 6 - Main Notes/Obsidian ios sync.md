# Obsidian ios sync

Hello!

I couldn't find definitive information on how well Syncthing works for syncing Obsidian notes between PC/Mac and an iOS device, so I gave it a go myself.

**Requirements:**

- Syncthing on your PC or Mac: [Link](https://syncthing.net/downloads/)

- Möbius Sync (Unofficial version of Syncthing) on your iOS device, requires the paid version to be able access files from Obsidians iOS sandbox. One time fee of 5,99 in EU.

- Be on the same network with each device you wish to sync.

**Guide:**

- Open up Möbius Sync on your iOS and see if you can find your PC/Mac in the "Add Remote Device" menu. (I found it easier to do it this way around, should work vice versa).

- Once the device has been found, choose the folder from iOS that you want to sync, you should be able to find the Obsidian Vault once you go pick an **External Folder -> On This iPhone -> Obsidian.**

- Choose the devices you want to sync to in the **Sharing** tab. Press OK.

- You should get a pop up on the Syncthing on the other device prompting you to Add the Folder. Pick where you want the Vault to be synced.

- Done! Give it a test!

I'll try my best to answer to any possible questions, I have only been using this for a few days now but it seems to be working perfectly for me so far and is far easier and cheaper than the previous solutions I have tried.
